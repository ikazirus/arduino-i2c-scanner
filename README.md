I2C scanner for arduino

## What is I2C on Arduino?
The I2C protocol involves using two lines to send and receive data: a serial clock pin (SCL) that the Arduino Controller board pulses at a regular interval, and a serial data pin (SDA) over which data is sent between the two devices.

## Connection for I2C
Connect your module I2C pins i.e., SCL and SDA pins to the Arduino SCL and SDA pins According to pin number assigned to various Arduino models or simple to SCL and SDA pins mark out on Board.

Be careful to connect SCL to SCL and SDA to SDA, or it may lead to no detection of module.
